          <p>
            Thanks to my eagerness and willing to learn, I have worked in
            several places for my short age. The experience I have in each one
            of this places, help me become not just a better developer but a
            better person too. Working with different disciplines or teams,
            helped me become more of a interdisciplinay engineer adn therefore
            deliver better results depending of each teams needs.
